# SocialPlus

A simple upgrade for the MoP Classic friends list.  
Easy to use, easy to understand, and makes the Social panel way better.

## ⭐ What It Does
SocialPlus fixes the old MoP Classic Social UI so it works the way you expect in 2025.

- Lets you **invite anyone** — Battle.net friends or normal WoW friends.
- Fixes weird **cross-realm** invite errors.
- Makes the friends list cleaner and easier to read.
- Adds **custom friend groups** so you can organize people your way.

## 🎯 Smarter Invites (BNet + Non-BNet)
The game’s default invite rules are messy in MoP Classic.  
SocialPlus replaces them with something that actually works:

- Invite Battle.net friends  
- Invite non-BNet WoW friends  
- Works cross-realm  
- Shows clear messages when an invite isn’t possible  
- No more random Blizzard restriction bugs

## 👥 Friend Groups
Sort your friends like folders:

- Make groups  
- Add or remove people  
- Collapse groups  
- Clean visual sections  
- Everything saves automatically

## 🎨 UI Improvements
- Shows correct faction icons  
- Restores missing invite buttons  
- No layout bugs  
- Feels native — blends perfectly with Blizzard’s UI  

## ⚙️ Simple Options
Right-click a group to:

- Hide offline friends  
- Collapse or expand  
- Rename or remove the group  
- Hide max-level characters  
- Toggle class-colored names  

## 🔧 MoP Classic Fixes
SocialPlus smooths out old MoP code problems:

- Fixes cross-realm invite issues  
- Fixes wrong restriction messages  
- Keeps offline players from showing wrong icons
